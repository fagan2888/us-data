    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the coastline of the United States, Puerto Rico, 
        and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The United States shoreline of the Great 
        Lakes is also included.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States
        in the use of these data.

              Numerous sources were used to perform quality-control and vertical 
              integration, including all the 1:1,000,000-scale National Atlas 
              map layers, a variety of online sources, and online USGS 
              topographic maps.  More information is available from the National

        Process_Description:
          All the 1:1,000,000-scale map layers were checked for vertical 
          integration.  Line positions were adjusted as necessary to remove 
          overlaps.  Wherever possible, linear features were separated by 300 
          meters, but were kept within 500 meters of their true location.
