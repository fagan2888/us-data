  Description:
    Abstract:  
      This map layer contains mortality information for United States Health 
      Service Areas (805 groups of counties).  Included are mortality rates by 
      sex and race (white and black) for the 11 leading causes of death, 8
      subset causes, and all causes combined, for 1988-1992.  Age-adjusted rates 
      are presented along with indicators of whether each rate is considered 
      reliable and whether it is significantly different from the corresponding 
      U.S. rate.  This is a revised version of the 1998 data set.  This data set 
      was also distributed with the name U.S. Mortality Database.

    Purpose:  
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      The U.S. Geological Survey assumes no responsibility for the use of these 
      data.

    Supplemental_Information: 
      This data comes from Pickle L.W., Mungiole M., Jones G.K., White A.A., 
      Atlas of United States Mortality.  Department of Health and Human Services 
      (DHHS) Publication. No. (PHS) 97-1015.  Hyattsville, MD: National Center 
      for Health Statistics, 1996.  Additional information may be obtained from

      The user is cautioned not to over-interpret apparent visual correlations 
      between spatial patterns of mortality and environmental and (or) 
      sociodemographic factors.  In many cases, patterns appear similar because 
      some other unmeasured factor causes both the risk factor and the mortality 
      patterns, not because the risk factor actually causes higher mortality.  
      Users are urged to confirm suspected correlations by a more complete 
      multivariate analysis which includes known risk factors for the disease.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        The COUNTYP020 file was read into Arc/INFO as a coverage and modified to 
        reflect the 1990 county boundaries.  The counties were aggregated to
        Health Service Areas (HSA's) and fields were added to the coverage for 
        the HSA name and number.  A new coverage of the Health Service Areas was 
        created.  The individual data base files (dbf's) from the Atlas of 
        United States Mortality for each cause-of-death were loaded into ArcView 
        and the attribute names were modified so cause-of-death was included.  
        The dbf files were then merged into one large dbf file, with all 19 
        causes-of-death included.  The dbf was converted to an INFO table which
        was then joined to the Health Service Areas coverage, and the result was 
        converted to shapefile format.

        ATLAS-CNTY1990 is an updated 1990 county boundary data set.  Shoreline

        Louisiana, Florida, New York, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and North
