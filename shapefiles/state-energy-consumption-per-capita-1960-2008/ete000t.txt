  Description:
    Abstract: 
      This data set portrays per capita energy consumption estimates for each 
      of the fifty individual States, for the District of Columbia, and in 
      aggregate for the United States, for the years 1960 to 2008.  The 
      estimates are given in British Thermal Units (Btu).  Included are 
      estimates for four energy-consuming sectors, which include residential, 
      commercial, industrial, and transportation.  Also included is an estimate 
      of total energy consumption that combines the four energy-consuming 
      sectors.  This is a replacement for the July 2010 data set.

      The residential sector consists of living quarters for private households.  
      Common uses of energy associated with this sector include space heating, 
      water heating, air conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, cooking, and 
      running a variety of other appliances.  The residential sector excludes 
      institutional living quarters. 

      The commercial sector consists of service-providing facilities and 
      equipment for businesses; Federal, State, and local governments; and other 
      private and public organizations, such as religious, social, or fraternal 
      groups.  The commercial sector includes institutional living quarters.  It 
      also includes sewage treatment facilities.  Common uses of energy 
      associated with this sector include space heating, water heating, air 
      conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, cooking, and running a wide variety 
      of other equipment.  It also includes generators that produce electricity 
      and/or useful thermal output primarily to support the activities of the 
      above-mentioned commercial establishments. 

      The industrial sector consists of all facilities and equipment used for 
      producing, processing, or assembling goods.  The industrial sector 
      encompasses the following types of activity: manufacturing; agriculture, 
      forestry, fishing and hunting; mining, including oil and gas extraction; 
      natural gas distribution; and construction.  Overall energy use in this 
      sector is largely for process heat and cooling and powering machinery, 
      with lesser amounts used for facility heating, air conditioning, and 
      lighting.  Fossil fuels are also used as raw material inputs to 
      manufactured products.  This sector includes generators that produce 
      electricity and/or useful thermal output primarily to support the above-
      mentioned industrial activities.

      The transportation sector consists of all vehicles whose primary purpose 
      is transporting people and/or goods from one physical location to another.  
      Included are automobiles; trucks; buses; motorcycles; trains, subways, and 
      other rail vehicles; aircraft; and ships, barges, and other waterborne 
      vehicles. 

    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States
      in the use of these data.

    Supplemental_Information:
      The Energy Consumption data set consists of five database files that are 
      distributed together.  The five files are:
      >etetpbt   Energy Consumption – Total Estimated Energy per Capita
      >eterpbt   Energy Consumption – Residential Energy Per Capita
      >etecpbt   Energy Consumption - Commercial Energy Per Capita
      >eteipbt   Energy Consumption – Industrial Energy Per Capita
      >eteapbt   Energy Consumption - Transportation Energy Per Capita

      To create the maps in the National Atlas Map Maker,
      <http://nationalatlas.gov/natlas/Natlasstart.asp>, the database files can 
      be joined to the State boundaries available from the National Atlas raw 
      data download page, <http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html>. 

      The data originally came from the Energy Information Administration's 
      State Energy Data 2001 Consumption tables at:
      <http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/_seds.html>.  The 
      date on the posted files was June 30, 2010.  For additional 
      information on Energy Information Administration definitions and

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        The file containing Consumption, British Thermal Units, 1960-2008,
        the file use_all_btu.csv was downloaded from the Energy Information 
        Administration web site.   

        To create the database of total per capita estimated energy consumption, 
        the fields containing estimated energy consumption per capita were 
        extracted from use_all_btu.csv and saved to a dBASE IV file.   Fields 
        for the State FIPS code and the State name were added.  

        To create the other four database files, both files were loaded into a 
        Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  

        For residential per capita estimated energy consumption, the fields 
        containing residential sector total energy consumed (TERCB) data and 
        resident population for each State (TPOPP) were extracted from 
        use_all_btu.csv.  Residential energy consumption per capita was calculated 
        by dividing TPOPP into TERCB.  The resulting Excel spreadsheet was 
        saved as a comma-delimited file, loaded into ArcMap, and saved as a dBASE IV file.  
        Fields for the State FIPS code and the State name were added.         

        For commercial per capita estimated energy consumption, the fields 
        containing commercial sector total energy consumed (TECCB) data and 
        resident population for each State (TPOPP) were extracted from 
        use_all_btu.csv.  Commercial energy consumption per capita was calculated 
        by dividing TPOPP into TECCB.  The resulting Excel spreadsheet was 
        saved as a comma-delimited file, loaded into ArcMap, and saved as a dBASE IV file.  
        Fields for the State FIPS code and the State name were added.         

        For industrial per capita estimated energy consumption, the fields 
        containing industrial sector total energy consumed (TEICB) data and 
        resident population for each State (TPOPP) were extracted from 
        use_all_btu.csv. Industrial energy consumption per capita was calculated 
        by dividing TPOPP into TEICB.  The resulting Excel spreadsheet was 
        saved as a comma-delimited file, loaded into ArcMap, and saved as a dBASE IV file.  
        Fields for the State FIPS code and the State name were added. 

        For transportation per capita estimated energy consumption, the fields 
        containing transportation sector total energy consumed (TEACB) data and 
        resident population for each State (TPOPP) were extracted from 
        use_all_btu.csv.  Transportation energy consumption per capita was calculated 
        by dividing TPOPP into TEACB.  The resulting Excel spreadsheet was 
        saved as a comma-delimited file, loaded into ArcMap, and saved as a dBASE IV file.  
        Fields for the State FIPS code and the State name were added.

        and/or useful thermal output primarily to support the activities of the 
        above-mentioned commercial establishments.

        The file of transportation consumption per capita energy contains
        consumption estimates for the transportation sector, which includes all 
        vehicles whose primary purpose is transporting people and/or goods from 
        one physical location to another.  Included are automobiles; trucks; 
        buses; motorcycles; trains, subways, and other rail vehicles; aircraft; 
        and ships, barges, and other waterborne vehicles.  Vehicles whose primary 
        purpose is not transportation (e.g., construction cranes and bulldozers, 
        farming vehicles, and warehouse tractors and forklifts) are classified in the 
        sector of their primary use. Natural gas used in the operation of natural gas 
        pipelines is included in the transportation sector.

        The data are given for each State, the District of Columbia, and the 
        United States as a whole, and are for the years 1960 to 2008.
