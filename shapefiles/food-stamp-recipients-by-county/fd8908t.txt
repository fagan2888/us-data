    Description:
      Abstract: 
        This map layer shows the estimated number of Supplemental Nutrition 
        Assistance (food stamp) recipients in the United States, by county, 
        for the years 1989, 1993, 1995, 1997-2002, and 2003-2008.  It is drawn 
        from United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service 
        (USDA/FNS) information on the number of people participating in the food 
        stamp program.  Those data were used in the production of the U.S. 
        Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty estimates.  Food stamp 
        recipient estimates are generally for July of the reference year; in a 
        few cases the States were able to provide data only for other reference 
        periods.  In 2008, the federal Food Stamps Program  was renamed the 
        Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States, 
        the United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, 
        or the U.S. Census Bureau in the use of these data.

      Supplemental_Information:
        To create the maps in the National Atlas Map Maker, 
        <http://nationalatlas.gov/mapmaker>, fd8902t.dbf was joined to the 
        county boundaries available from the National Atlas data download page, 
        <http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html>.  The 1989 data were joined to 
        the 1990 county boundaries (co1990p020), the 1993, 1995, and 1997-1999 
        data were joined to the 2000 county boundaries (co2000p020), and the 
        2000-2008 data were joined to the 2001 county boundaries (countyp020); 
        the more detailed 2012 county boundaries can also be used with these 
        data. 

        The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the new name 
        for the federal Food Stamp Program, as of October 1, 2008.  Data 
        originally came from the U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and 
        Poverty Estimates web site, 
        <http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/model/tables.html>.

        Process_Description: 
          The Food Stamp data for 1989, 1993, 1995, and 1997-2002 were 
          downloaded in Excel format.  A row containing header information was 
          added, and the file was loaded into ArcView and saved as a dBASE IV 
          file.  The three files containing population estimates were 
          downloaded, loaded into ArcView, and saved as dBASE files.  The 
          population estimate files were joined to the food stamp file.  Fields 
          were added to contain the percentage of food stamp recipients for each 
          year.  The values for the new fields were calculated by dividing the 
          appropriate population estimate into the number of food stamp 
          recipients and multiplying by 100.  Fields that were blank were given 
          values of -9999 or -9.0.  A record was added for Yellowstone National 
          Park (FIPS 30113).  Records for individual States were deleted.
