  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer includes construction minerals operations in the United
      States.  The data represent commodities covered by the Minerals 
      Information Team (MIT) of the U.S. Geological Survey.  The mineral 
      operations are plants and (or) mines surveyed by the MIT and considered 
      currently active in 2003.  Excluded are construction sand and gravel and 
      crushed stone.  This is a replacement for the June 2004 map layer.
    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or 
      the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. 
    Supplemental_Information: 
      Additional minerals operations information can be obtained from the U.S. 
      Geological Survey Minerals Information web page at 
      http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    No tests for logical consistency were performed on this map layer.

  Completeness_Report:
    This category includes only economically significant U.S. minerals 
    operations covered by the Minerals Information Team of the U.S. Geological 
    Survey and considered currently active in 2003.  No energy minerals 
    operations are included.  No secondary (recycling, "downstream") operations 
    are included.  This map layer shows plants and (or) mines in the United 
    States.

    Clay operations (ball clay, common clay) may have many satellite pits, not 
    all of which are specifically included.  The points included are 
    representative of the companies.

      Source_Contribution: 
        The USGS Minerals Yearbook (MYB) contains statistical data and 
        information about approximately 90 commodities.  Active operations were 
        identified from tables and text in the MYB.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        AMIS contains both proprietary and nonproprietary information.  For each 
        commodity, the Minerals Information Team (MIT) extracted from AMIS the 
        nonproprietary information useful for this application and placed this 
        information in a separate MicroSoft Excel spreadsheet.  The MIT 
        determined latitude and longitude for each mineral operation from at 
        least one of the following sources: 
        > Minerals Availability System/Minerals Industry Location System 
        > (MAS/MILS) CD-ROM, U.S. Bureau of Mines Special Publication 12-95
        > http://www.yahoo.com Searches performed on company or operation 
        > name.
        > http://www.switchboard.com Searches performed on company or 
        > operation name.
        > http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/multisystem_query_java.html Searches 
        > performed on company or operation name.
        >
        Whenever possible the locational information was checked for accuracy.  
        The minerals operations were then placed in commodity groupings. 
        The resulting MicroSoft Excel spreadsheet containing construction 
        minerals operations was converted to a text file.  The text file was 
        loaded into ArcView and a shapefile was created.
