  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set consists of National Wilderness Preservation System areas 
      of the United States.  The data set was created by extracting these 
      wilderness areas from the National Atlas map layer, Federal Lands and 
      Indian Reservations of the United States.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in 
      the use of these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's Arc/INFO GIS software, the data set was checked for label 
    errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  Polygon topology was built 
    for the data set using the BUILD command.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes National Wilderness Preservation System areas for 
    all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 
    the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The minimum map resolution is 640 acres or one 
    square mile.  Generally, features under this size are not shown.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Wilderness areas were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands 
        and Indian Reservations map layer.  Attributes for feature type, 
        feature name, agency ownership, URL, State, and State FIPS codes were 
        retained.

        Fifteen new wilderness areas were added:
        > 1) Priest Wilderness, Virginia (from PTRWILD)
        > 2) Three Ridges Wilderness, Virginia (from PTRWILD)
        > 3) Spanish Peaks Wilderness, Colorado (from SPWILD)
        > 4) Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness, Colorado (from BRCWILD)
        > 5) Black Rock Desert Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 6) Little High Rock Canyon Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 7) Calico Mountains Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 8) East Fork High Rock Canyon Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 9) High Rock Canyon Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 10) High Rock Lake Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 11) North Black Rock Range Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 12) North Jackson Mountains Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 13) Pahute Peak Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 14) South Jackson Mountains Wilderness, Nevada (from NCAWILD)
        > 15) Steens Mountain Wilderness, Oregon (from STEENSWLD)

        The boundary of Mud Swamp/New River Wilderness, Florida was adjusted 
        using MSWILD, and the boundary of Bob Marshall Wilderness, Montana 
        was adjusted using BMWILD.  The Southern portion of Buckhorn 
        Wilderness, which had been incorrectly identified as Colonel Bob 
        Wilderness, was corrected.
