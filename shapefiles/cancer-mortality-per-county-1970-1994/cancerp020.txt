  Description:
    Abstract:  
      This data set contains 1970-1994 cancer mortality information for counties 
      in the United States.  Included are death rates, number of deaths, 
      confidence levels, and expected number of deaths for white males and white 
      females for 20 cancers.  The data are from a cancer mapping project in the 
      National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and 
      Genetics (DCEG).

    Purpose:  
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of 
      these data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
         Several counties and independent cities in Montana, New York, Virginia, 
         and Wisconsin from the National Atlas 1980 county dataset, COUNTY1980, 
         were merged into adjacent counties to form the NCI units. The Arc/INFO 
         Dissolve command was used to perform the merging of counties.  Polygons 
         for Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Great Lakes were deleted.
         
         The white male and white female, county-based cancer database files, 
         CANCER, were downloaded from
         <http://www3.cancer.gov/atlasplus/download.html>.  An additional file, 
         SPARSE_DATA, drawn from the Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United 
         States, 1950-94, and containing cancer rates for mapping purposes was 
         received via electronic mail.  The field names in the database files 
         were changed to create unique names, and the files were merged into a 
         single database file.  The database file was joined to the spatial 
         dataset described above.

        combined to create the NCI reporting unit.  In Virginia independent 
        cities were combined with the surrounding counties to create the NCI

        This field was used to create the maps in the National Atlas of the 
        United States and the Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States: 
        1950-94.  It is the death rate excluding areas considered unstable by 
        the National Cancer Institute.  The rates are for cancer XXX (see table 
        below) per 100,000 population for gender Y (see table below).  The 
        numbers are age-adjusted to the 1970 U.S. population.  An area was 
        considered unstable if (a) the observed number of deaths was less than 
        6; (b) the observed number of deaths was less than 12 and the rate was 
        not significantly different statistically from the U.S. rate; or (c) the 
        expected number of deaths was less than 6 and the rate was not 
        significantly different statistically from the U.S. rate.
