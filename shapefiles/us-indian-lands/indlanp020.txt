  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer shows Indian lands of the United States.  Only areas of 640 
      acres or more are included.  Federally-administered lands within a 
      reservation are included for continuity; these may or may not be 
      considered part of the reservation and are simply described with their 
      feature type and the administrating Federal agency.  This is an updated 
      version of the December 2004 map layer.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
      States in the use of these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's Arc/INFO GIS software, the map layer was checked for label 
    errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  Polygon topology was built 
    for the map layer using the BUILD command.
  Completeness_Report:
    This map layer includes Indian reservation polygon features for the 
    United States.  The minimum map resolution is 640 acres or one square 
    mile.  Generally, features under this size are not shown.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Working in Arc/INFO, Indian reservations and Federal lands internal 
        to them were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands map 
        layer.  Isolated features under 640 acres were deleted. Attributes for 
        feature type, name, administering agency, State, and State FIPS codes 
        were retained.  Adjacent Indian reservations having the same feature 
        type, name, and administering agency were merged.  State attributes of 
        merged Indian reservations were then updated.  Names for non-Indian 
        lands were deleted.  For polygons without label points, the points were 
        created and the polygons were assigned a null value.
