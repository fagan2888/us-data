  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer shows the locations of wells maintained by the U.S.
      Geological Survey (USGS) that are used to monitor the effects of droughts
      and other climate variability on ground-water levels.  The Ground-Water 
      Climate Response Network consists of a national network of about 140 wells 
      monitored as part of the Ground-Water Resources Program.  It is 
      supplemented by more than 200 wells monitored as part of the Cooperative 
      Water Program that meet the same network criteria, which are: open to a 
      single, known hydrogeologic unit; known well construction that allows good 
      water-level measurements; located in unconfined aquifers or near-surface 
      confined aquifers that respond to climatic fluctuations; minimally 
      affected by pumpage and likely to remain so; essentially unaffected by 
      irrigation, canals, and other potential sources of artificial recharge; 
      long-term accessibility; and well has never gone dry (not susceptible to 
      going dry).  
 
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States 
      or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.  

    Supplemental_Information:
      This map layer represents a 'snapshot' of ground-water levels on a 
      specific date.  Current ground-water level information, updated on a daily 
      basis, is available from the Ground-Water Climate Response Network home 
      page at <http://groundwaterwatch.usgs.gov/>.  More than 200 of the network
      wells are equipped with telemetry that transmits a reading of water level 
      to an office by satellite or telephone.  The data typically are updated 
      every 4 hours.
