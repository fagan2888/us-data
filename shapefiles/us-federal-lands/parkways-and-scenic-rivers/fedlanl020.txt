    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the linear federally-owned land features (i.e.,
        national parkways, wild and scenic rivers, etc.) of the United States,
        Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was created by
        extracting linear federal land features from the 1:2,000,000-scale
        individual State DLG files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey.
        These files were then merged into a single map layer.  This is a revised
        version of the July 2001 map layer.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States 
        in the use of these data.

        Process_Description:
          The 2MILBD file was originally digitized by the National Mapping 
          Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas 
          of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The
          sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the
          early 1980's.  The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale
          and 1:2,000,000 scale Bureau of Land Management State base maps. 
          These data were published on CD-ROM in 1995. Using Arc/INFO software,
          the DLG optional format files were converted to Arc/INFO coverages
          using the DLGARC command.  Only linear Federal land features and
          attribute information were extracted for inclusion.  The individual
          State coverages were then merged together using the Arc/INFO command
          APPEND.
