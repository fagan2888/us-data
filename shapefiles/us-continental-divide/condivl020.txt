  Description: 
    Abstract: 
      This data set portrays the Continental Divide of the United States.  The
      data set was created by extracting Hydrologic Unit Boundary line features
      from an existing National Atlas layer.  The source data are aligned with 
      the individual 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) hypsography 
      files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. 
    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. 
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of 
      these data.

      Process_Description: 
        ATLAS-HUC was read into Arc/INFO.  The four sectionals (10,11,12, and 
        15) from DLG-HP covering the Continental Divide were used as references 
        to determine which drainage boundaries to select from ATLAS-HUC.  The 
        selected arcs were put into a new file, which was then converted to 
        shapefile format.
