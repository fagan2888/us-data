  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer portrays the major acquisitions of territory by the United
      States of America.  Only areas in North America, the Caribbean, and Hawaii 
      are included.  Also shown are areas that were part of the United States at 
      one time but which have been ceded to other countries.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in 
      the use of these data.  
    Supplemental_Information:
      The United States also includes additional territories not shown in this 
      map layer.  The following areas are or have been territories of the United 
      States:

      American Samoa <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/asgpage.htm> was 
      acquired under the 1899 Treaty of Berlin between Germany, Great Britain, 
      and the United States.  The islands are now an unorganized and 
      unincorporated territory of the United States and are administered by the 
      U.S. Department of the Interior <http://www.doi.gov/>, Office of Insular 
      Affairs <http://www.doi.gov/oia/>.

      The Federated States of Micronesia 
      <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/fsmpage.htm> was part of the Trust 
      Territory of the Pacific Islands, but in November 1986 became a fully 
      independent country in free association with the United States.  While the 
      country is independent, the United States provides defense and some 
      financial assistance, and in return is allowed military use of the 
      islands.

      Guam <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/gumpage.htm> became a territory 
      of the United States after the Spanish-American War.  Under the December 
      10, 1898 Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded the island to the United States.  
      Guam was captured by Japan in 1941 but was retaken by the United States in 
      1944.  It became an organized, unincorporated territory of the United 
      States in August, 1950, and is administered by the U.S. Department of the 
      Interior <http://www.doi.gov/>, Office of Insular Affairs 
      <http://www.doi.gov/oia/>.

      The Northern Mariana Islands 
      <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/cnmipage.htm>  were part of the Trust 
      Territory of the Pacific Islands, and became a self-governing United 
      States commonwealth in 1986.

      The Republic of the Marshall Islands 
      <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/rmipage.htm> was part of the Trust 
      Territory of the Pacific Islands, but in November 1986 became a fully 
      independent republic in free association with the United States.  While 
      the country is independent, the United States provides defense and some 
      financial assistance, and in return is allowed military use of the 
      islands.

      The Republic of Palau <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/palaupage.htm> 
      was part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, but in October 
      1994 it became a fully independent republic in free association with the 
      United States.  While the country is independent, the United States 
      provides defense and some financial assistance, and in return is allowed 
      military use of the islands.

      The minor outlying islands which are territories of the United States 
      include Midway Atoll <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/midwaypage.htm> 
      (1867), Palmyra Atoll <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/palmyrapage.htm> 
      (1898, with Hawaii), and Wake Atoll 
      <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/wakepage.htm>  (1899), Baker Island 
      and Howland Island <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/bhpage.htm> (1857), 
      Jarvis Island <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/jarvispage.htm> (1858), 
      Johnston Atoll <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/johnstonpage.htm> 
      (1858), Kingman Reef <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/kingmanpage.htm> 
      (1922), and Navassa Island 
      <http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/navassapage.htm> (1857).
 
      The Philippines became a territory of the United States after the Spanish-
      American War.  Under the December 10, 1898 Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded 
      the islands to the United States for $20 million.  In 1935 the Philippines 
      became a self-governing commonwealth.  Japan took over the Philippines 
      from 1942-1944, but the United States regained the islands in 1945, and 
      full independence was granted in July, 1946.
