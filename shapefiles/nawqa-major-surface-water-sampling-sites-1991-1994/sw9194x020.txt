  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set shows the 1991 and 1994 National Water-Quality Assessment 
      (NAWQA) study units' major surface-water sampling sites.  These sites are 
      in NAWQA's fixed network and (or) in a bed sediment and tissue network.  
    Purpose: 
      This data set was created to display NAWQA's major surface-water sampling 
      sites identified as part of a fixed network and (or) a bed sediment 
      and tissue network.  The points were generated from the latitude and 
      longitude coordinates in the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water 
      Information System (NWIS) for the selected stations.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The National Water-Quality Assessment Program is designed to describe the
      status and trends in the quality of the Nation's ground- and surface-
      water resources and to provide a sound understanding of the natural and 
      human factors that affect the quality of these resources (Leahy and 
      others, 1990).  The building blocks of the national assessment are 
      investigations in major hydrologic systems of the Nation, referred to as 
      "Study Units".  The study units are divided into three groups.  Each 
      group of study units is intensively studied on a rotational schedule of 
      three-year periods.  The first group began in fiscal year 1991 (FY 1991 
      ran from October 1990-September 1991), the second in  fiscal year 1994 
      and the third in fiscal year 1997.  This data set includes major surface-
      water sampling sites from the first two groups of study units. 

      Sampling sites within the NAWQA program are grouped into "networks".  A 
      surface-water sampling network is characterized by the type of sampling 
      activity, such as what constituents are sampled and (or) the sampling
      frequency.  This data set includes sites in a fixed network and (or) 
      bed sediment and tissue network.  A NAWQA fixed site is a site on a 
      stream, at which streamflow is measured and samples are collected for 
      temperature, salinity, suspended sediment, major ions, nutrients, and 
      organic carbon, to assess the broad-scale spatial and temporal character 
      and transport of inorganic constituents of stream water in relation to 
      hydrologic conditions and environmental settings (Gilliom and others, 
      1995).  Samples are collected regularly at fixed sites for at least two 
      years.  All fixed sites are considered "basic fixed sites" but some are 
      referred to as "intensive fixed sites" if the sampling frequency 
      increased during selected seasonal periods and if pesticide samples were 
      collected regularly for 1 year (Gilliom and others, 1995).

      A NAWQA bed sediment and tissue site is a site where bed sediment and 
      (or) tissue samples are collected and analyzed for trace elements and 
      hydrophobic organic contaminants in streambed sediment and in the tissue 
      of aquatic organisms.  Bed sediment and (or) tissue samples are typically 
      collected once at a site, however some sites are resampled.  Some of 
      these sites are within NAWQA's major bed sediment and tissue networks, 
      while some are not.  The two major bed sediment and tissue networks are 
      the Occurrence survey and the Spatial Distribution survey.  The 
      Occurrence survey focuses on what hydrophobic contaminants are present, 
      while the Spatial Distribution survey focuses on these contaminants 
      through broader areal sampling.  Though these surveys constitute separate 
      bed sediment and tissue networks, no differentiation is made in this data 
      set.  However, a bed sediment and tissue site in either the Occurrence 
      survey or the Spatial Distribution survey is differentiated from 
      remaining bed sediment and tissue sites that are not part of these 
      surveys.  These remaining sites are either part of another bed sediment 
      and (or) tissue network, or part of a synoptic network at which bed 
      sediment and (or) tissue samples were collected.  A synoptic network 
      consists of a single or multiple sites sampled to investigate specific 
      conditions during selected seasonal or hydrologic periods.  In this data 
      set, synoptic sites at which bed sediment and (or) tissue samples are 
      collected are considered to belong to a bed sediment and tissue network. 

      The major surface-water sampling sites in the 1997 NAWQA study unit 
      starts will be added to this data set in the near future.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Sites identified as part of the fixed network were checked with existing 
      record-keeping of fixed stations by the NAWQA National Synthesis team.  
      Sites identified as part of the bed sediment and tissue network were 
      verified as having bed sediment and (or) tissue data.  Other stations 
      were added to the data that were not part of NAWQA's bed sediment and 
      tissue networks but where bed sediment and (or) tissue samples had been
      collected.  Additional attribute values were checked by NWIS software on 
      entry. 
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    No checks for logical consistency were performed on this data set.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set shows selected NAWQA study unit surface-water sampling sites
    in the lower 48 States.  The study units are those which became active in 
    either 1991 or 1994.  Site selection was based on whether the site was 
    grouped within a fixed network and (or) a bed sediment and tissue network.  
    NAWQA surface-water sampling sites grouped in other networks are not 
    included in this data set.

        The sampling sites were plotted with their respective drainage basin 
        boundaries as provided by the NAWQA Study Units, and were verified to

      Process_Description:
        The NAWQA sites spatial data set (nawqapt) was generated from multiple 
        files from NAWQA's national aggregated database.  ARCPLOT was used to 
        select the subset of sites in nawqapt that were part of the fixed 
        network, the Occurrence survey and Spatial Distribution survey bed 
        sediment and tissue networks, and other sites where bed sediment and 
        (or) tissue samples were known to have been collected.  These sites 
        were added from nawqapt into the reselected set and the data set was 
        saved as a new file.  Fields for Study Unit ID (Suid), Year (Yr), and 
        network indicators (Fix and Bst) were added and populated from 
        information in nawqapt.  The attribute Name was populated from 
        additional information in nawqapt.  Related stations were deleted from 
        the data set.  (A related station is a USGS station at which samples 
        were collected, located in close proximity to a main or primary 
        station.  No tributaries, point sources, or any other water-quality 
        impacting features exist between the primary and related stations and
        consequently, samples collected at both the primary and related 
        stations are analyzed as if they were collected at a single physical 
        location.)  The data set was converted from NAD27 to NAD83.

      Attribute_Definition: 
        An indication of whether or not a surface water sample site is a fixed 
        network site.  A fixed network site is one where the stream flow is
        measured and samples are collected at a fixed frequency.  The
        information from the samples includes temperature, salinity, suspended 
        sediment, dissolved solids, major ions and metals, nutrients, and 
        organic carbon.  These characteristics are used to assess the broad-
        scale spatial and temporal character of the stream water, and to assess 
        the transport of inorganic constituents by the stream water in relation 
        to hydrologic conditions and environmental settings.
