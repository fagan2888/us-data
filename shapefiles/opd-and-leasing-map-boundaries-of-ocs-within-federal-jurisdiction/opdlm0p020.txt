  Description:
    Abstract: 
      This data set shows official protraction diagram (OPD) and leasing map
      boundaries covering areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) within
      Federal jurisdiction.  They are generated in accordance with 30 Code of
      Federal Regulations (CFR) 256.8 to support Federal land ownership and
      mineral resource management.  Leasing Maps are irregularly shaped areas
      developed early in the offshore program for near-shore areas in the Gulf
      of Mexico.  Elsewhere, OPD's were developed on a Universal Transverse
      Mercator (UTM) grid and are approximately one degree in latitude by two
      degrees in longitude, except in northern areas where they are three
      degrees in longitude.  This data set shows existing and planned OPD 
      limits.  Actual limits of Federal jurisdiction are defined by various 
      international and maritime boundaries not presently depicted.  Lease Map 
      and OPD boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico were historically cut at the 
      Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary, while in other areas the full OPD 
      boundary is shown and therefore may include non-OCS lands within the 
      rectangularly shaped OPD boundary.  While the Gulf of Mexico Region uses 
      the North American Datum of 1927, for this data set those coordinates 
      have been transformed to the North American Datum of 1983 to coincide 
      with the OPD's in the other Minerals Management Service regions.  This 
      file updates the September, 2000 data set by including the OPD 
      boundaries for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      Other sources must be used if exact coordinates are required for legal 
      purposes.  No responsibility is assumed by the Minerals Management 
      Service or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        The source data for the OPD and Leasing Map data set is a theoretical
        mathematical derivation.  In-house computer programs were used to
        generate the boundaries for each diagram.  Leasing Maps and OPDs in
        the Gulf of Mexico were converted from NAD27 to NAD83, and the
        individual OPD's and Leasing Maps were then appended into one data
        set.  For the purposes of this map, Atlantic Region OPD's south of 27 
        degrees North latitude were clipped to eliminate the appearance of 
        overlap with Gulf of Mexico OPD's.  The file was output in shapefile 
        format for inclusion in the National Atlas of the United States.
