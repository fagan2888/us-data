    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the estimated use of water in counties in the
        United States, in the year 2005.  The map layer was extracted from
        the U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources of the United States water
        use database, which is a long term data set that documents
        information on water use since 1950.

        This map layer contains information about water use for public
        supply, industrial, irrigation, mining, livestock, and
        thermoelectric power, by county throughout the United States.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale
        data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or
        the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
      Supplemental_Information:
        Data were drawn from Circular 1344 which serves as one of the few
        sources of information about regional or national trends in water
        withdrawals.  Circular 1344 provides information on eight categories
        of water use: public supply, domestic, irrigation, livestock,
        aquaculture, industrial, mining, and thermoelectric power.

        The complete report can be found at
        <http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1344/>

        Water-use data compiled by the States are stored in the USGS
        Aggregate Water Use Data System (AWUDS).  AWUDS is designed to store
        both mandatory and optional data elements.  The system allows users
        to input data, perform quality assurance and quality control, and
        produce tables of water-use data for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005.
        These water-use data are used by USGS, other agencies, organizations,
        academic institutions, and the public for research, water-management
        decisions, trend analysis, and water-demand forecasting.

        To create maps that are similar to the maps in the National Atlas
        <http://nationalatlas.gov/natlas/NatlasStart.asp>, wu2000t.dbf can be
        joined to the 2001 county boundaries available from the National
        Atlas raw data download page,
