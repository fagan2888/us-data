      Nonemployer Statistics (NES)
      U.S. and sub-national economic data by industry for nonemployer businesses.
      A nonemployer business is one that has no paid employees, has annual business receipts of $1,000 or more ($1 or more in the construction industries),
      and is subject to federal income taxes.
      Nonemployer Statistics cover all sectors of the economy and are available for the U.S., states, metro areas, and counties, but not for places.
      Nonemployer Statistics have been released every 5 years since 1972, for years ending in "2" and "7" for selected industries in conjunction
      with the Economic Census. Beginning with reference year 1998, the Nonemployer Statistics have been released as an annual data series.

      Some data is suppressed  for the following reasons:
      Withheld to avoid disclosing data for individual companies; data are included in higher level totals.
      Not available or not comparable.
      Withheld because estimate did not meet publication standards.
