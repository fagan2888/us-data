  Description:
    Abstract:
      A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural 
      Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as 
      the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to 
      the release (June 2004) of several new products: an updated paper map of 
      North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.  
      These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries 
      for download. This data has been revised and re-released in 2006.

      The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 
      1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, 
      railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, 
      bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their 
      relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base 
      with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data 
      outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in 
      the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of 
      the data.

      The North American Atlas - Hydrography data set shows the coastline, 
      linear hydrographic features, and area hydrographic features in North 
      America. This data has been revised and re-released in 2006.

      This data set was produced using digital files supplied by Natural 
      Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey.  

    Purpose:
      The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and 
      analysis at the national and continental level.  These data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto 
      Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological 
      Survey in the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international
      organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America 
      under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).  
      The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help 
      prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the 
      effective enforcement of environmental law.  The Agreement complements the
      environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
      (NAFTA).  Further information on the CEC is available from 
      http://www.cec.org/ or from

      All North American Atlas data sets are available in three data formats: 
      Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile, and Geography Markup Language 
      (GML).

      Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North 
      American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection.  The 
      following parameters were used for the map:
      >Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 
      >Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 
      >False_Easting (metres): 0.0 
      >False_Northing (metres): 0.0 
      >Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 
      >Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      Where possible, attribute data were quality controlled by creating 
      symbolized digital displays or hard copy plots, which were visually 
      verified with digital or hard copy reference data.  Attribute data that 
      could not be verified in such a manner were interactively queried to check 
      for anomalies such as duplication of data in fields requiring unique 
      values and incorrect feature coding.  Data for areas outside of Canada, 
      Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for context;
      Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility 
      for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    Topology was built and a quality control of the hydrography polygon data was 
    done in order to ensure topological polygon structure.  A quality control of 
    the linear hydrography data was done in order to ensure topological 
    consistency within each country and across country boundaries.  
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes hydrography for all of North America as shown at 
    1:10,000,000 scale.  The data completeness reflects the content of the 
    source data, the integration done by the cartographers, and the quality 
    control of the content performed by each country.
  Positional_Accuracy: 
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: 
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        Positional accuracy of the data is unknown.  Positions are dependent on 
        the accuracy of the source data and on the result of the generalization 
        and integration processes.  Data for areas outside of 
        Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for 
        context; Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística 
        Geografía e Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no 
        responsibility for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this 
        data.

        For the U.S. portion of the map, linework from the 1:7,500,000 
        Hydrography file was generalized and fitted to the coastline by 
        cartographers at the National Atlas of the United States.  The attribute 
        for the country was added to the data.

        Linework from the 1:4,000,000 Topographical Dataset for Mexico was 
        selected, generalized and fitted to the coastline by cartographers at 
        the Atlas of Canada.  The attribute for the country was added to the

        Drainage needed to extend features to the map extent was compiled from 
        the 1:10,000,000 National Atlas of Canada Reference Map Series data set.  
        Linework was fitted to the coastline.  The attribute for the country was

      Process_Description:
        Linework was cartographically adjusted along country boundaries to 
        ensure correct connection of adjoining hydrographic features. 
      Process_Date: 2004

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Because the linework came from many different sources and scales, a 
        final cartographic review was done to the full hydrographic file to 
        ensure cartographic compatibility at 1:10,000,000 scale.  A quality 
        control of the linear hydrography data was done in order to ensure 
        topological consistency within each country and across country 
        boundaries.  Polygon topology was created so the area hydrography 
        features could be shown as polygons and an area fill could be used for 
        cartographic representation.  Each country then performed a final 
        cartographic check to verify the selection and position of the linework.  
        The attributes were also verified.

      Process_Description:
        Using the original 1:10,000,000 hydro files (NA_Hydro04) the USA hydro feature lines 
	(lakes and rivers) were refined using the 1:2,000,000 hydro data files (HY0301) as a 
	guide. Some spatial features were added and others were corrected. Names were taken 
	from the 1:2,000,000 data (HY0301), then researched and tagged to the geometry based 
	on 1:100,000 scale base maps. For Alaska, the names were taken from the 1:250,000 
	scale sheets.

      Process_Description:
Using the original 1:10,000,000 hydro files (NA_Hydro04) which had the names for the hydro features in Mexico added, the data for the USA was replaced with the revised and named American data. Hydro features were adjusted along the border in Canada to match the changes in the USA. Then the Canadian hydro feature lines (lakes and rivers) were tagged with names taken from the 1:1,000,000 National Scale Frameworks Hydrology file (NSFH_2003), the 1:10,000,000 paper map and the 1:7,500,000 reference map data. The quality control of the data was performed in order to check the attributes and geometry, and to make corrections before release.
