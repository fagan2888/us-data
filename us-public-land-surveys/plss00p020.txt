  Description: 
    Abstract: 
      This data set portrays the Public Land Surveys of the United States, 
      including areas of private survey, Donation Land Claims, and Land Grants 
      and Civil Colonies.  This is a revised version of the January 2003 data set.
    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in 
      the use of these data. 
    Supplemental_Information:
      All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by a rectangular 
      system of surveys called the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), established 
      and regulated by the Bureau of Land Management.  The original public 
      domain includes the land ceded to the Federal Government by the Thirteen 
      Original States, supplemented with acquisitions from native Indians and 
      foreign powers.  It encompasses major portions of the land area of 30 
      western States.  

      Under Congressional mandate, cadastral surveys of public lands were 
      undertaken to create parcels suitable for disposal by the Government.  The 
      PLSS was developed for this purpose.  The PLSS is a rectangular survey 
      system that typically divides the land into 6-mile square townships, which 
      are further subdivided into 1-mile square sections (the data in the 
      National Atlas do not include section-level information).  The extension 
      of the rectangular system of surveys over the public domain has been in 
      progress since 1785.  These surveys form the basis of patents issued when 
      public lands pass out of Federal ownership.  

      Certain lands were excluded from the public domain and not subject to 
      survey and disposal.  These lands include the beds of navigable bodies of 
      water, national installations such as military reservations and national 
      parks, and areas such as land grants that had already passed to private 
      ownership prior to subdivision by the Government.  

      Data describing the PLSS is required by Federal surface and mineral 
      management agencies, as well as any organization concerned with land 
      ownership in the 30 western States that were formed from the public 
      domain.  Additionally, many agencies have encoded natural resource or 
      environmental inventory data based on the PLSS.

      Process_Description: 
        Public Land Survey System data were collected from 1:500,000 and 
        1:1,000,000 State base maps for the western United States.  The eastern 
        States were collected from existing 1:100,000-scale base maps.  Data 
        from both sources were integrated into 1:2,000,000 State-level DLG 
        files, then generalized and vertically integrated with 2MILBD, ATLAS-
        CNTY, and ATLAS-HY.  The resulting Public Land Survey System DLG files 
        were published on CD-ROM in 1995.  The DLG optional-format files were 
        then converted to Arc/INFO coverages, and the individual State files 
        were paneled together into a national coverage.  Numeric DLG codes were 
        translated into English, non-polygon features were deleted, and the data 
        set was converted to shapefile format.
