  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer shows crime statistics for the United States for the
      years 1994-2000, drawn from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program data
      compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and archived at the
      Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
      Crime data are reported by county and are provided for eight crimes:
      murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny,
      motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Statewide allocation data are not
      included in this map layer.  Crime data are adjusted to compensate for
      incomplete reporting by individual law enforcement agencies.  See the
      online codebook at 
      <http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi-bin/bob/archive2?study=3451&path=NACJD&docsonly=yes>
      for more information.  This is an update of the January 2003, map layer; 
      fields for the above crime statistics, normalized by crime population, have 
      been added.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the Department of Justice, the National 
      Atlas of the United States, or the ICPSR in the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information: 
      Some of the crime data reported in this file was estimated.  Where
      agencies reported for 12 months, the data were included as reported.
      Where agencies reported for between three and eleven months, the data
      were increased by a weight of (12/months reported).  Where agencies
      reported for one or two months, the actual data were not included,
      but estimated data for the entire year were calculated based on rates
      computed using data from 12-month reporting agencies within the same
      geographic stratum (defined by population group) within that State.
      Where agencies did not report at all, no estimations were performed.

  Completeness_Report:
    This map layer includes crime statistics for the 50 United States as
    collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from reports submitted
    by agencies and States participating in the Uniform Crime Reporting
    Program.  This is a voluntary program so the data may not include reports
    from all law enforcement agencies.  Data collected for a State but not
    attributable to a specific county (Statewide allocations) are not
    included.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Comma-delimited text files for individual years, containing selected
        attributes, were received from the Bureau of Justice Statistics data
        archive (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan.  The text files were
        loaded into Excel and output in dBase IV format, then loaded into
        ArcView for processing.  FIPS codes in the data were converted to
        strings and leading zeros added as appropriate.  The FIPS code for
        Dade County, FL was changed in the 1994, 1995, and 1996 files to match
        the new FIPS code for Miami-Dade County, FL.  Attribute names were
        modified to allow combination of data from several years.  The
        individual year files were merged into one large file and saved in
        dBase IV format.

        The county boundaries file was loaded into ArcView and the FIPS code
        for Dade County was changed to the new code for Miami-Dade County.
        The name was also changed.  The area of Skagway-Yakatut-Angoon Census
        Area, Alaska was divided into Yakatut Borough and Skagway-Hoonah-
        Angoon Census Area, and the FIPS codes were adjusted.  County
        boundaries for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were deleted.
        Twelve polygons that represented water areas were also deleted.

        The crimes database was joined to the edited county boundaries file
        and the result saved in shapefile format.

      Process_Description:
        The ATLAS-CRIMES9400 shapefile was loaded into ArcGIS for processing 
        and editing.  A query was run to select records for each year where
        the coverage index for a year was greater than zero and the crime
        population for the same year was zero, resulting in about 20 selections 
        for each year.  Where there were crime statistics for a particular year 
        in the selected records, the arrest population value for that year was 
        substituted for the zero value in the crime population field.  If there 
        were no crime statistics for a particular year in the selected records, 
        the coverage index was reset to zero.  New fields were added for each 
        crime normalized by population.  Queries were run for each year to 
        detect records with missing data (coverage index was zero, crime 
        population was zero, and all crime statistics were zero.)  The new 
        fields were populated with the value -9999 for records with no data 
        available (referred to as missing data by NACJD).  For records with 
        data, the values for the new fields were calculated by dividing the 
        crime population for a particular year into the crime statistic for that 
        year and then multiplying the result by 100.

      Attribute_Definition:

        the year ending in XX.  The map layer includes data for the years from 
        1994 (XX=94) to 2000 (XX=00).  A value of 100 indicates that all 
        agencies in the county reported for 12 months of the year, and none of 
        the data were estimated.  A value of 0 indicates that all data for the 
        county are based on estimates rather than reported data.  The coverage 
        indicator (CI) for each county is calculated as follows:
        >CI = (1-(sum((agency pop/pop_arrXX)((12-months reported)/12))))*100
        Where agency pop is the population represented by the reporting
        agency for that year, and pop_arrXX is the total population for the 
        county (as defined above).  The value for "months reported" will be 0 
        for agencies reporting 1-2 months of data, because any data provided by
        these agencies was set to zero and the data were estimated using the
        procedure described above.
