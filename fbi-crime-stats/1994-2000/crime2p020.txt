  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer shows crime statistics for the United States for the
      years 2001-2002, drawn from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program data
      compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and archived at the
      Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR).
      Crime data are reported by county and are provided for eight crimes:
      murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny,
      motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Statewide allocation data are not
      included in this map layer.  Crime data are adjusted to compensate for
      incomplete reporting by individual law enforcement agencies.  See the 
      online codebook at 
      <http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi- bin/bob/archive2?study=4009&path=NACJD&docsonly=yes> 
      for more information.  
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the Department of Justice, the National
      Atlas of the United States, or the ICPSR in the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Some of the crime data reported in this file was estimated.  Where
      agencies reported for 12 months, the data were included as reported.
      Where agencies reported for between three and eleven months, the data
      were increased by a weight of (12/months reported).  Where agencies
      reported for one or two months, the actual data were not included,
      but estimated data for the entire year were calculated based on rates
      computed using data from 12-month reporting agencies within the same
      geographic stratum (defined by population group) within that State.
      Where agencies did not report at all, no estimations were performed.
      For New York City in 2001, the total number of murders in the FBI
      data files is 3,452, which includes 2,823 victims of the September 11 
      bombing.  For more information on imputation procedures please see

  Completeness_Report:
    This map layer includes crime statistics for the 50 United States as
    collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from reports submitted
    by agencies and States participating in the Uniform Crime Reporting
    Program.  This is a voluntary program so the data may not include reports
    from all law enforcement agencies.  Data collected for a State but not
    attributable to a specific county (Statewide allocations) are not
    included.  Limited offense data were available for Kentucky, Mississippi,
    Montana, and South Dakota.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Comma-delimited text files for individual years, containing selected
        attributes, were received from the Bureau of Justice Statistics data
        archive (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan.  The text files were
        loaded into Access and output in dBASE V format, then loaded into
        ArcMap for processing.  State and County FIPS code fields were combined
        into one FIPS field and were converted to text.  Attribute names
        were modified to conform to the attribute names from previous
        years.  The FIPS code for Dade County, FL was changed to match the
        new FIPS code for Miami-Dade County, FL.  The dBASE files did not contain 
        records for Denali, Alaska, so one was added to each file with all values 
        set to zero.
        
        The county boundaries file was loaded into ArcMAP, joined to the dBASE V 
        crime files, and the result was exported to a new shapefile.

        A query was run on the shapefile to select records for each year where the 
        coverage index for that year was greater than zero and the crime 
        population for the same year was zero, resulting in about 20 selections 
        for each year.  Where the selected records included crime statistics for a 
        particular year, the arrest population value for that year was substituted 
        for the zero value in the crime population field.  If the selected records  
        included no crime statistics for a particular year, the coverage index was 
        reset to zero.  New fields were added for crime normalized by population. 
        Queries were run for each year to detect records with missing data 
        (coverage index was zero, crime population was zero, and all crime 
        statistics were zero.)  The new fields were populated with the value -9999 
        for records with no data available (referred to as missing data by NACJD).  
        For records with data, the values for the new fields were calculated by 
        dividing the crime population for a particular year into the crime 
        statistic for that year and then multiplying the result by 100.
