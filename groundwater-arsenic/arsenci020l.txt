  Description:
    Abstract:
      This image shows national-scale patterns of naturally occurring 
      arsenic in potable ground-water resources of the continental 
      United States.  The image was generated from the most recent 
      arsenic measurement available for each of 31,350 wells and 
      springs across the United States.  Over 20,000 of the water 
      samples were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey between 1973 
      and 2001.  The remainder of the samples were collected by State 
      agencies and analyzed by comparable laboratory techniques.  The 
      data set shows a moving 75th percentile, which can also be 
      described as the maximum arsenic concentration found in 75% of 
      samples within a moving 50 km radius (the median size of a U.S. 
      county).  In other words, for any given 50-km-radius region in 
      the data, lower concentrations of arsenic were found in 75% of 
      sampled wells, while higher concentrations of arsenic were found 
      in 25% of sampled wells.  This is a revised version of the 
      August 2002 map layer, with a corrected shoreline for Greenland.

    Purpose:
      This map layer is intended to provide national-scale, broad-brush 
      answers to questions such as, "Where in the country might at 
      least 25 percent of wells have high arsenic concentrations?"  The 
      data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 
      1:2,000,000-scale data.  

      The data should not be used to infer an arsenic concentration for 
      an individual well.  Although the data set shows that 
      concentrations of arsenic are likely to be higher in certain 
      geographic regions relative to others, there can be a high degree 
      of local variability because of factors such as the well’s depth, 
      the type of aquifer used by the well, and local geology and water 
      chemistry.  The only way to be certain of the arsenic 
      concentration in the water supplied by any given well is to have 
      the water tested.  

      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the 
      use of these data.

    Supplemental_Information:
      Some of the samples came from individual homeowner wells used, 
      without treatment, for drinking water.  Other samples came from 
      wells supplying water for irrigation and other purposes.  The 
      data set does not include samples of saline or thermal water; all 
      the samples represent aquifers used for drinking water supply, 
      even if the specific well was not used to supply drinking water.  

      The intent of this study was to describe the quality of the 
      untreated ground-water resource itself, rather than to directly 
      measure the quality of drinking water by monitoring water from 
      taps and other "finished" water.  Comparisons of these findings 
      with those from previous drinking-water studies indicate that the 
      concentrations reported here are comparable on a national scale 
      to concentrations in untreated ground water tapped by water 
      utilities across the Nation.  These findings also reflect the 
      quality of the ground-water tapped without treatment by 
      homeowners and small community water systems.

      Arsenic concentrations are measured in units of micrograms per 
      liter (ug/L), which is equivalent to parts per billion.

      The following table describes the display of the 75th percentile 
      of arsenic concentrations in the GeoTIFF image:

      Process_Description:
        A detailed description of how this map layer was created, and 
        discussion on interpreting the map layer, may be found in 
        USARSENIC.  Information on sources is included under Data Set 
        Credit, above.

        The area of the United States was divided into a grid using 
        equal-area hexagons 100 kilometers across (the median size of a 
        U.S. county).  For areas with a minimum data density of five 
        wells per hexagon, the 75th percentile of arsenic concentration 
        was computed.  A moving 75th percentile was then approximated 
        by "smoothing" across hexagon boundaries based on neighboring 
        values.

        that region.  The concentrations were recorded in micrograms 
        per liter (ug/L; equivalent to parts per billion), and were 
        converted to colors according to the following table.  All 
        arsenic concentrations greater than 50 micrograms per liter 
        were recoded as 50 micrograms per liter.  There may be 
        intermediate colors in the image that are not included in this
