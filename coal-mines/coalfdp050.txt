  Description: 
    Abstract:
      This data set shows the coal fields of Alaska and the conterminous United 
      States.  Most of the material for the conterminous United States was 
      collected from James Trumbull's "Coal Fields of the United States, 
      Conterminous United States" map (sheet 1, 1960).  The Gulf Coast region 
      was updated using generalized, coal-bearing geology obtained from State 
      geologic maps.  The Alaska coal fields were collected from Farrell 
      Barnes's "Coal Fields of the United States, Alaska" map (sheet 2, 1961).  
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      National level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:5,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of 
      these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Topology for this data set was built using the CLEAN command within
    Arc/INFO.  This command eliminates dangling nodes, calculates intersections
    of arcs, eliminates redundant arcs, and creates a polygon attribute table.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set is a representation of the coal fields in the conterminous
    United States and Alaska.  There are no coal fields in Hawaii.

      Process_Description:
        All the paper maps were manually digitized on a tablet using Arc/INFO.
        All data were then appended into one data set.  This data set was edited 
        to resolve inconsistencies between maps and to form a polygon coverage.  
        The final data set was then attributed using the coaltype codes
        described within this document.
