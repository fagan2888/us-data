Additionally, some sites were not included because geospatial data were not available, or it is a leased site.
 
Final selection and approval of sites were coordinated and approved by each of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps headquarters programs for installation geospatial information and services (IGI&amp;S). Each IGI&amp;S program coordinated review and approval with their respective real property officers to the greatest practical extent. 
 
Installation data provided by the Service IGI&amp;S programs depict the general location of installations, sites, ranges, and other areas managed by DoD as reported in the Federal Real Property Profile.  Point locations were provided by an authoritative source or derived from notional (non-surveyed) site boundaries and represent approximate locations.  Points are placed either at the relative center of each site or near the center of the most commonly used portion of the site. Users may note positional inaccuracies in the point placement when zooming to specific site locations, particularly those with no boundaries.
 
The initial raw data set was aggregated from several key DoD site location data sources by the DISDI Program and provided to each Service component for review.  The Service IGI&amp;S Programs coordinated with support teams to review the data, confirm site/location information, and provide corrections.  All feedback received from the Services was incorporated into the final database.
