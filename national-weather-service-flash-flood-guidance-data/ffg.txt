Downloading Flash Flood Guidance Data

There are six files (five required and one optional) for using NWS Flash Flood Guidance shapefile data:
nws_ffg.sbn -- REQUIRED
nws_ffg.sbx -- REQUIRED
nws_ffg.shp -- REQUIRED
nws_ffg.shx -- REQUIRED
nws_ffg.dbf -- REQUIRED
nws_ffg_legend.avl -- optional
The first four (sbn, sbx, shp and shx extensions) are static; you only need to download them once. Click on the link below to download a ZIP file with these files (2.5MB compressed, 7.4MB uncompressed). 

The dbf file (520K) is routinely updated several times per day. 

The optional legend file (also included in the nws_ffg.zip) will help you reproduce the color scheme we are using. If using ArcView, you will need to copy it into your c:\esri\av_gis30\arcview\legend_avl\ directory and load it manually through the legend editor.
